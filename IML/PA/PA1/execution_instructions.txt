I did my homework in one single Jupyter Notebook.
This notebook is attached with all the inputs( and outputs) it uses.
One needs to download it, open it for example using Anaconda, and click on the
,,restart the kernel, then re-run the whole notebook (with dialog),, button, and
all the blocks will be executed.
My report is included in the notebook via markdown cells and print outputs.
